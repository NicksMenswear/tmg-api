# TMG API Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- `pip install tox`

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# Create venv
tox

# Actiave venv
source .tox/py310/bin/activate

# Run dev server
python main.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

To run tests, use tox command: 
```bash
tox
```
