# TMG API Server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `pip install tox`

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

### Create virtual environment 

```bash
# Create venv
tox

# Activate venv
source .tox/py312/bin/activate
```

Note that pre-commit git hook will be installed as well

### Run dev server

```sh
python main.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

### Run tests

```sh
tox
```
